    <h1>OUR SOLAR SYSTEM</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="GALAXY2.jpg" alt="Milky Way">
        <p>The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years...<br>
The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars.<br>
 There are probably at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way.<br>
 The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge of the Orion Arm, one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust. <br>
The stars in the inner ˜10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. <br>
The very center is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which is likely to be a supermassive black hole.</p>

        <h2>1. Sun</h2>
        <img src="sun.jpg" alt="Sun">
        <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. <br>
It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<br>
 It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. <br>
Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, i.e. 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.<br>
 About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.</p>

        <h2>2. Venus</h2>
        <img src="venus.jpg" alt="Venus">
        <p>The second planet from the sun, Venus is terribly hot, even hotter than Mercury.<br>
 The atmosphere is toxic. <br>
The pressure at the surface would crush and kill you.<br>
 Scientists describe Venus’ situation as a runaway greenhouse effect. <br>
Its size and structure are similar to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway "greenhouse effect." <br>
Oddly, Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction of most planets.<br><br>

        <img src="earth.jpg" alt="Earth">
        <p>The third planet from the sun, Earth is a waterworld, with two-thirds of the planet covered by ocean.<br>
 It’s the only world known to harbor life. <br>
Earth’s atmosphere is rich in life-sustaining nitrogen and oxygen. <br>
Earth's surface rotates about its axis at 1,532 feet per second (467 meters per second) — slightly more than 1,000 mph (1,600 kph) — at the equator. The planet zips around the sun at more than 18 miles per second (29 km per second).<br><br>

        <h2>4. Mars</h2>
        <img src="MARS.jpg" alt="Mars">
        <p>The fourth planet from the sun, is a cold, dusty place.<BR>
 The dust, an iron oxide, gives the planet its reddish cast.<BR>
 Mars shares similarities with Earth: It is rocky, has mountains and valleys, and storm systems ranging from localized tornado-like dust devils to planet-engulfing dust storms. <BR>
It snows on Mars. And Mars harbors water ice. Scientists think it was once wet and warm, though today it’s cold and desert-like.<BR>

Mars' atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist on the surface for any length of time.<BR>
 Scientists think ancient Mars would have had the conditions to support life, and there is hope that signs of past life — possibly even present biology — may exist on the Red Planet.<BR>

        <p>The fifth planet from the sun, Jupiter is huge and is the most massive planet in our solar system. <BR>
It’s a mostly gaseous world, mostly hydrogen and helium.<BR>
 Its swirling clouds are colorful due to different types of trace gases.<BR>
 A big feature is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has raged for hundreds of years.<BR>
 Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, and with dozens of moons, it looks a bit like a miniature solar system.<BR><BR>

        <h2>6. Saturn</h2>
        <img src="Saturn-.jpg" alt="Saturn">
        <p>The sixth planet from the sun is known most for its rings. <BR>
When Galileo Galilei first studied Saturn in the early 1600s, he thought it was an object with three parts.<BR>
 Not knowing he was seeing a planet with rings, the stumped astronomer entered a small drawing — a symbol with one large circle and two smaller ones — in his notebook, as a noun in a sentence describing his discovery.<BR>
 More than 40 years later, Christiaan Huygens proposed that they were rings.<BR>
 The rings are made of ice and rock. Scientists are not yet sure how they formed. <BR>
The gaseous planet is mostly hydrogen and helium. It has numerous moons.<BR><BR>

        <h2>7. Uranus</h2>
        <img src="URANUS.jpg" alt="Uranus">
        <p>The seventh planet from the sun, Uranus is an oddball. <BR>
It’s the only giant planet whose equator is nearly at right angles to its orbit — it basically orbits on its side.<BR>
 Astronomers think the planet collided with some other planet-size object long ago, causing the tilt.<BR>
 The tilt causes extreme seasons that last 20-plus years, and the sun beats down on one pole or the other for 84 Earth-years.<BR>
 Uranus is about the same size as Neptune. Methane in the atmosphere gives Uranus its blue-green tint. It has numerous moons and faint rings.<BR>

        <img src="Neptune.jpg" alt="Neptune">
        <p>The eighth planet from the sun, Neptune is known for strong winds — sometimes faster than the speed of sound. <BR>
Neptune is far out and cold. The planet is more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth. <BR>
It has a rocky core. Neptune was the first planet to be predicted to exist by using math, before it was detected. <BR
Irregularities in the orbit of Uranus led French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to suggest some other might be exerting a gravitational tug.<BR>
 German astronomer Johann Galle used calculations to help find Neptune in a telescope. <BR>
Neptune is about 17 times as massive as Earth.<BR><BR>
