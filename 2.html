<font size=6 color=white>The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the Universe. <br>

Under this theory, space and time emerged together 13.799±0.021 billion years ago with a fixed amount of energy and matter that has become less dense as the Universe has expanded<br>.
 After the initial expansion, the Universe cooled, allowing the first subatomic particles to form and then simple atoms. <br>
Giant clouds later merged through gravity to form galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today.<br> 
It is possible to see objects that are now further away than 13.799 billion light-years because space itself has expanded. <br>
This means that objects which are now 46 billion light years away can still be seen in their distant past, because at that time they were much closer to us.

The prevailing model for the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory.<BR>
 The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded.<BR> 
The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space.<BR>
 <IMG SRC=spectacular_sight-1920x1080.JPG HIGHT=600 WIDTH=500> <BR><BR> A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe.<BR>
 The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.<BR><bR>
